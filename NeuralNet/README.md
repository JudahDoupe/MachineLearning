# Neural Network Todo List
* ~~learning rate~~
* ~~Implement Cost Function~~
* ~~Plot Cost function~~
* ~~Add it data randomization and create cross validation dataset,test dataset~~
* ~~Threshold to stop training when cost gets small enough~~
* ~~Add in the 10 fold cross validation.~~
* ~~Modularize stuff so we can run many configurations easily~~
* Add in leave 1 out. 1 test case train with 149
* Regularization
* Add in pickling to save backprop state
* Refactor initialization of network


## Final notes
 We finished all that was required by the assignment and a little extra.
 The only stuff left on the todo were stretch goals that didn't have any effect
 on the assignments outcome/grade.

 It has a full factorial style testing in the NetworkOptimizer. 95% of the functionality
 is probably working fine. We're pretty sure that there is something small that
 is causing weird results. All in all not bad for a week or two of work.
