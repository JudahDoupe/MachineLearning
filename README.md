# MachineLearning

## Todo
* ~~learning rate~~
* Regularization
* ~~Implement Cost Function~~
* ~~Plot Cost function~~
* ~~Add it data randomization and create cross validation dataset,test dataset~~
* Threshold to stop training when cost gets small enough
* Add in the 10 fold cross validation. 
* Add in leave 1 out. 1 test case train with 149
* Modularize stuff so we can run many configurations easily
* Add it pickling to save backprop state
* Refactor initialization of network
* Maybe add way to save backprop to file
